# tech-interview

## Introduction

The challenge was solved putting some to display how I usually organise and set the project structure.

## To run the project:

1. Clone the repository:
   `git clone https://github.com/pablongo/tech-interview.git`
   or
   `git clone git@github.com:pablongo/tech-interview.git`
   or
   `gh repo clone pablongo/tech-interview`
2. Run `npm intall`
3. Run: `npm run dev`

## What I've done:

- DRY pattern
- Compisition Patterns
- HOC Pattern
- SOLID Principles
- Modularization
- Redux Toolkit
- Input debouncing

## With more time i'll have done:

- Integration tests with Cypress.
- Unit testing with Jest.
- Screenshoot tests with Jest.
- Connect the Conversion between BTC, USD and EUR to an API that provided values in real time.
- Add Spinners and Loaders to Async components.
- Spend more time on UI

### Libraries:

- React
- Redux Toolkit
- Tailwind CSS
